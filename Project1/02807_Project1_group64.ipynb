In that way, we avoid writing for explicit loops for repeated operations. Instead, we perform arithmetic operations with universal functions, + , / and * directly on the Series. The operations on pandas Series follows broadcasting rules similar to that of NumPy's where they are automatically applied row-wise, and if there are mismatches in Series dimension, the ouput series will have NaNs appended to the same length of the Serie with larger ndim. \n","\n","Next, instead of looping and appending the calculated imdb_rating to an empty list and later adding it to the original dataframe df, we create the new column 'imdb_rating_pandas' by directly adding the output from vectorised Series operations done before. We are able to do so despite the original dataframe df and the output Serie does not have the same dimension in length, becasue pandas Ufuncs allow for index alignment in Series and Datframes, so any missing entries will be replaced with NaN. Thus, the calculated imdb ratings for movies with more than 1000 votes will be added to the correct locations indicated by their index from the original dataframe.

Therefore, we find the index of movies that has __vote_count__ over 1000 by finding the index of values in the converted vote_count numpy array column that is greater than 1000. Using the found indexes we are able to create two numpy arrays v (vote counts) and R (vote averages) by indexing both the numpy array __vote_count__ and the numpy converted original data frame df\\[vote averages\\] (with __to_numpy__). Thereafter, we define the new column __'imdb_rating_numpy'__ to take NaN values, otherwise calculated rating values for the movies with index of interest. The ratings are calculated using the universal functions /, * and + from Numpy, we perform the same arithmetic as what was done in the vectorised pandas solution, and following the broadcasting rules of Numpy. The difference is that in this case, if one array's dimension is smaller than the other, 1 will be preprended their shape. This solution is vectorised because first of all we avoided dynamic typing. Secondly, we allowed for parallel operations such that when computing the ratings we are not bound to any particular order, every element in an array could be computed independently."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"evCHi0shCuPv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635770115320,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Hanlu

we can see from the line profiler output, we have reduced the amount of time spent filteirng and finding the needed values of vote count and vote average compared to our vectorised pandas solution, where filtering directly on the dataframe df took significant amount of time. Another major improvment over the vectorised pandas solution would be at the last line where arithmetic operations for calculating the ratings happen, where here we spent only about 1/3 execution time. The reason for why the numpy solution happens to be alot faster is that it is more memory sufficient due to homogeneity in datatype, hence generally faster in arithmetic operations.
